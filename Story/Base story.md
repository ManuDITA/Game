#story 
Here goes the underlying story that motivates the main character over the 9 hell loops. 

Protagonist: late 30s man
Occupation: restorer of books
Background of the character: empathy (he will talk to the damned souls in the infernum and understand why they are there). 
Maybe without a memory. With the trip through the infernum he tries to understand why his wife killed herself??

He is not dead. Maybe the whole story can be about him dreaming and going through the circles to find out why her wife killed herself?
