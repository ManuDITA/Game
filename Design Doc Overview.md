# Core Idea

  
Puzzle based game. Each inferno level has a grand puzzle. Walk around, interact and talk, figure pieces of the puzzle out and finish it.

Every time you take a step, it decreases the time you have left. You die and a new iteration begins. The impact on the world carries through.

Art style - Layered 2D - See Donâ€™t starve, Undertale etc. Pixel art. Medieval fantasy.
