Story of the level 1

First loop of the infernum is the limbo. The word comes from "Lembo" that is the  border just before the abyss. 
Here are the souls of children that died without a baptesim (so are not cristian yet) and people that lived before the age of Christ. 

The souls face no punishment (unlike in the other loops) but won't be saved. They desire to see god and continuously sigh deeply making air shake.


[[Base story]]
If we link it to the story of the mom that killed herself, we could introduce her unborn baby (but the player doesn't know that it's his baby or his wife's).
